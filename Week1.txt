MiraTechnologies Week One Task

I'm excited to be part of the MiraTechnologies bootcamp 2021. The onbaording was awesome.

It's a great opportinuty to connect with developers around the world and learn from them.

The onbaording started with the introduction of the company

Next was the introduction about the bootcamp and the guidelines.

The git class followed suit after the onboarding and the this task was assigned.


I'm Alemoh Rapheal from Mobile track thanks for the priviliedge.
